## How to Run This Fabulous Project Locally 💫

1. **Extract the Files**  
   Unzip the files you've just received. Trust me, you'll want to get started right away. Other option is to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyrhun/EcoSunnah.git
2. **Open `ecoSunnah_index.html`**  
   Navigate to the project folder. Open the `ecoSunnah_index.html` file in your preferred browser. You’ll immediately be transported into an enchanting world of sustainable shopping.

3. **For the Ultimate Shopping Experience:**  
   For that flawless local server experience, use tools like `Live Server` in VS Code. It's truly the secret ingredient for our project’s smooth operation.

4. **Optional—Run the Backend Server (If You Want to Be Extra):**  
   If you're feeling fancy and want to enable form submission capabilities:
   - Navigate to your terminal and install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
   - Run the server by typing `node server.js` (Or just `node app.js`).
   - Now your local server is up and running on port 3000.
5. Navigate through the pages:
    Categories: Browse products and add them to the cart.
    Cart: View selected items and proceed to checkout.
    Checkout: Complete your purchase using the checkout form.
